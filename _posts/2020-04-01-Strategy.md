Scoita Bank wanted to increase brand awareness in a sea of Mortgage offers, here were my briefs for differentiation:

* Insight: Digital Natives Don't Trust Financial Institutions - they trust people.
* The Plan: Unique crowdfunded experiences let people play the role of the bank and increase access to Mortgages
