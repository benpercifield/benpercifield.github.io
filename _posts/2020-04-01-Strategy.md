## Repair Café Creative Strategy


* **The Background:** A repair café is a meeting in which people repair household electrical and mechanical devices, computers, bicycles, clothing, etc. They are organised by and for local residents. Repair cafés are held at a fixed location where tools are available and where they can fix their broken goods with the help of volunteers. Its objectives are to reduce waste, to maintain repair skills and to strengthen social cohesion.

* **The Ask:** Raise awareness and event attendance for Repair Café Toronto ("RCT"), 
* **Secondary Ask:** Increase Fixers Volunteer Signup
* **The Challenge:** Break the like-attracts-like, word of mouth self-reinforcing cycle of volunteers recruiting their friends, and attendance skewing older. Find a way to attract a younger crowd to the Repair Café.
* **Research:** Circular Economy Market Analysis, Social Listening, Video Trawl
* **Insight:** People want to focus their time and effort **on solutions**, not problems
* **Strategy:** Two birds one stone: Increase event attendance & volunteer sign-up in one fell swoop by taking advtange of our current culutral context: Covid contagion, by embroadening Repair Café's mission from fixing physical things to intangible things: reimagining a more sustainable society, culture, economy, etc.
* **Creative Output:** In a world full of (discussions around) problems, Repair Cafe (as Toronto's one-stop-shop for Person-to-Person practical sustainable solutions) can be the forum for sustainable action, shifting the narrative from a complex present to a brighter future.
