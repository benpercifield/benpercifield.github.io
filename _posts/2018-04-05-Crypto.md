<h2> How to Make an Automatically Updating Cryptocurrency Portfolio In Google Sheets </h2>

<h3>
I taught myself how to code a javascript macro to get market prices and update a spreadsheet in realtime
</h3>

It really was not that difficult and in this post I'll walk you through

<center><h2>1. How I did it.</h2></center>
The first version I created uses the plug-in <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptofinance/bhjnahcnhemcnnenhgbmmdapapblnlcn?hl=en">cryptofinance</a> to get live market values. 



The function, `increaseLine()`  is called every 15 minutes to print a new row.
```
function increaseLine()
{

  var sheet1 = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName("PORTFOLIO");
  var sheet2 = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName("Currency Profits");
  SpreadsheetApp.setActiveSheet(sheet1);
  modifyCell("A1", true, "I3", "J7", "J8", "J9", "J10","J11","J12","J13","J14","J15","J16","C20","K4","J17","I2", "H18", "H19","J3");
  updateSpark();
  updatePercents();
  SpreadsheetApp.setActiveSheet(sheet2);
  
}
```

The line graphs automatically update as they are referencing a row, not a specific set of values.

<center><h2>3. Lessons Learned</h2></center>
The further I took this, the further I developed it. I learned about Sparklines, which can make a line graph in a single cell for up to 100 values. 15 minutes * 100 = 1500 minutes, 1440 minutes in a day, which gave me the last day of action for a given trackable asset:
