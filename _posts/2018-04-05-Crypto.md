<h2> How to Make an Automatically Updating Cryptocurrency Portfolio In Google Sheets </h2>

<h3>
I taught myself how to code a javascript macro to get market prices and update a spreadsheet in realtime
</h3>

<center><h2>1. How I did it.</h2></center>
This was the first version I created, it uses the plug-in <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptofinance/bhjnahcnhemcnnenhgbmmdapapblnlcn?hl=en">cryptofinance</a> to print live market values every 15 minutes in a new row. The line graphs automatically update as they are referencing a row, not a specific set of values.

<center><h2>3. Lessons Learned</h2></center>
The further I took this, the further I developed it. I learned about Sparklines, which can make a line graph in a single cell for up to 100 values. 15 minutes * 100 = 1500 minutes, 1440 minutes in a day, which gave me the last day of action for a given trackable asset:
