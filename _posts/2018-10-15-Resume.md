## Role: HusBen
#### Sabbatical 
#### Duration: September 2019 - Present
#### Location: Chicago, Toronto

After many months of discussion, my wife and I decided to move abroad during Summer 2019. This required several trips to explore international job markets in person, which led to me taking a sabbatical from full-time employment.

Now in Toronto, I am actively looking for a role that fits my unique skillset as a content creator, event producer, and Chinese language & cross-cultural expert. Job does not need to include all three areas.

<li>In October 2019 my wife received a formal offer from her advertising agency to transfer to Toronto. We made the call that moving to Canada was the right move for us.</li>
<li>In the interim I've worked as an Uber delivery biker, sushi waiter, handyman and husband.</li>
