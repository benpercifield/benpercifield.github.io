Fun fact about me: I can ask for an apple juice in 14 languages. Why did I choose apple juice? 

* It is the most consistently-available drink with a standardized taste. Orange juice might taste better overall, but is more volatile: it has a higher ceiling yet a lower floor.
* There is nothing worse than ordering an orange juice and getting tang or orange drink in return. Sure, I conceed that at its best, OJ > AJ, but the wide range of flavor makes me reticent to make it my go-to drink when abroad.
* In my experience, apple juice tastes the same everywhere. It's a rare occasion when ordering an apple juice and being surprised by the flavor.
* I enjoy using the local language to ask for apple juice because it instantly creates a rapport with the locals. This is my apple juice omni-language strategy.
