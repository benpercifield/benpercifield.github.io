* [Branded Positive Affirmation Mask, Instagram Demo:](https://www.instagram.com/a/r/?effect_id=862120040905902&ch=N2UzMDA2NTYwMTUzYWNlMGY5MjQ5M2NmNjA4YTVmZjE=)
* The Branded Affirmation Mask taps into a fascination, almost obsession with irony. The positive brand affirmation mask allows people to not even metaphorically but literally don a mask to be as branded as they are ironic. Irony sells, and giving the consumer the activation puts them at the center of their experience. The unbranded mask pushes the consumer to engage with the Brand - neutral to its interaction after being put on.
